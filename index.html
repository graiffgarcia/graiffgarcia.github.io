<h1>Ricardo Graiff Garcia's Web 1.0 Site</h1>

<p>Welcome to my wonderfully antiquated website! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Political Science Department at The Ohio State University, a part-time data scientist at Nationwide, and above all, a lover of funk music. </p>

<p>Here, you'll find my <a href = "files/cv.pdf">CV</a>, current as of Feb. 2020. You can also check out the December 2019 World Bank report that I co-authored, <a href = 'files/Energy Vulnerability in Female-Headed Households_Final_English.pdf'>Energy Vulnerability in Female-Headed Households: Findings from the Listening to Citizens of Uzbekistan Survey.</a></p>

<p>You can e-mail me at <span class="obfuscate">
    rica<span>null</span>rdo<span>null</span>@<span>null</span>graiffgarcia<span>null</span>.com</span>; my twitter (which I never use) is @graiffgarcia; my instagram (which is full of pictures of my cat) is graiffgarcia.</p>
    
<p>The site is bare-bones like this because <a href = "https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">websites are just too big nowadays</a> and that makes the web worse for everyone. I don't want to inundate your browser with third-party cookies and Wordpress garbage!</p>
