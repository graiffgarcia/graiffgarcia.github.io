<h1>Ricardo Graiff Garcia's Web 1.0 Site</h1>

<p>Welcome to my website, which I try (and fail) to keep under 1KB! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Political Science department at The Ohio State University (expected to graduate in Aug. 2021), a part-time data scientist at Nationwide, and an experienced bass player, even though I frequently neglect to practice so I can "write" my "dissertation".</p>

<p>Here, you'll find my <a href = "files/cv.pdf">CV</a>, current(ish) as of Apr. 2021. You can also read the 2019 World Bank report that I co-authored, <a href = 'files/Energy Vulnerability in FHHs.pdf'>Energy Vulnerability in Female-Headed Households: Findings from the Listening to Citizens of Uzbekistan Survey.</a>    

<p>My e-mail is <span class="obf">rica<span>null</span>rdo<span>null</span>@<span>null</span>graiff<span>null</span>garcia<span>null</span>.com; gra<span>null</span>iffg<span>null</span>arci<span>null</span>a is my username on Twitter and GitHub.
