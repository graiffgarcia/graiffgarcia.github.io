# Animal Crossing New Horizons: Turnip Prophet

Turnip Prophet is a price calculator/price predictor for Animal Crossing: New Horizons turnip prices.

The purpose of this fork is to predict how many Bells you will receive upon selling your turnips. It includes an input option wherein you can include the amount of turnips you bought on Sunday. It then gives you the amount of Bells that you would receive if you sell at the guaranteed minimum or potential maximum values, for each row on the table. Everything else in the code is the exact same as the original.

As I'm forking this repo for my personal use only, I have not included any translations of any of the new text fields I created. The new text works in English only.
