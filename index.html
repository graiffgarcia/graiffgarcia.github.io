<h1>Ricardo Graiff Garcia's Web 1.0 Site</h1>

<p>Welcome to my wonderfully antiquated website! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Political Science Department at The Ohio State University, a part-time data scientist at Nationwide, and above all, a lover of funk music and a devout fan of <a href = 'https://muse.jhu.edu/article/528310/pdf?casa_token=rbz6-5krZg0AAAAA:l7TLAJuuq3Lhj6BAmvPPz8O23p9-Qg76PBO9_HFDN-OaAaASnYXf2lCEcdD7oUHUU8xK3cfr7i8'>Roger Troutman</a>. </p>

<p>Here, you'll find my <a href = "files/cv.pdf">CV</a>, current as of Apr. 2020. You can also check out the 2019 World Bank report that I co-authored, <a href = 'files/Energy Vulnerability in Female-Headed Households_Final_English.pdf'>Energy Vulnerability in Female-Headed Households: Findings from the Listening to Citizens of Uzbekistan Survey.</a>    
<br>
When reading my CV, please keep an eye out for the impact that <a href='https://polisci.osu.edu/people/acree.11'>Professor Brice Acree</a> had. Working for him helped me earn a PRISM fellowship, which in turn contributed to my getting my current role at Nationwide. I owe it to him.</p>

<p>You can e-mail me at <span class="obfuscate">rica<span>null</span>rdo<span>null</span>@<span>null</span>graiff<span>null</span>garcia<span>null</span>.com; my twitter (which I never use) is @gra<span>null</span>iffgar<span>null</span>cia; my instagram (which is full of pictures of my cat) is graif<span>null</span>fgarci<span>null</span>a.</span></p>
    
<p>The site is bare-bones like this because <a href = "https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">websites are just too big nowadays</a> and that makes the web worse for everyone. I don't want to inundate your browser with third-party cookies, remote fonts, and Wordpress garbage!</p>
