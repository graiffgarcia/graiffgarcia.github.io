<h1>Ricardo Graiff Garcia's Web 1.0 Site</h1>

<p>Welcome to my website, which I always try to keep under 1KB! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Political Science Department at The Ohio State University (expected to graduate in August 2021), a part-time data scientist at Nationwide, and an experienced bass player who hasn't practiced daily for a while (thanks, grad school!).</p>

<p>Here, you'll find my <a href = "files/cv.pdf">CV</a>, current as of Apr. 2020. You can also read the 2019 World Bank report that I co-authored, <a href = 'files/Energy Vulnerability in Female-Headed Households_Final_English.pdf'>Energy Vulnerability in Female-Headed Households: Findings from the Listening to Citizens of Uzbekistan Survey.</a>    

<p>You can e-mail me at <span class="obfuscate">rica<span>null</span>rdo<span>null</span>@<span>null</span>graiff<span>null</span>garcia<span>null</span>.com; the username gra<span>null</span>iffg<span>null</span>arci<span>null</span>a is also how you can find me on Twitter and GitHub (and also on Instagram, where I post an inhuman amount of pictures of my cat Louise).
