<h1>Dr. Ricardo Graiff Garcia's Web 1.0 Site</h1>

<p>Welcome to my website, which I try (and fail) to keep under 1KB! I got a Ph.D. from the Political Science department at The Ohio State University in Aug. 2021. I am also an experienced bass player, even though I seriously neglected to practice this year so I could finish <a href='epc.pdf'>my dissertation</a>, available at the link right there. It's also available on OhioLink, if you have access to that â€” but the one posted here has a few little corrections.</p>

<p>You can also find my <a href="files/cv.pdf">CV</a>, current as of August 2021. You can also read the 2019 World Bank report that I co-authored, <a href='files/Energy Vulnerability in FHHs.pdf'>Energy Vulnerability in Female-Headed Households: Findings from the Listening to Citizens of Uzbekistan Survey.</a>    

<p>My e-mail is <span class="obf">rica<span>null</span>rdo<span>null</span>@<span>null</span>graiff<span>blahblahblah</span>garcia<span>yadayadayada</span>.com; gra<span>null</span>iffg<span></span>arci<span>null</span>a is my username on Twitter and GitHub.</span></p>
